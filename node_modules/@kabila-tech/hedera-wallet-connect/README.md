This package managed by the Hedera community and is intended to be a standard for ecosystem
wallets and dApp providers utilizing [WalletConnect](https://walletconnect.com) as a their
communications protocol. It utilizes the
[`@hashgraph/sdk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hashgraph/sdk) and provides functions to
facilitate implementing the
[WalletConnect <> Hedera JSON-RPC spec](https://specs.walletconnect.com/2.0/blockchain-rpc/hedera-rpc)
which has been defined through the collaborative HIP process in
[HIP-820](https://hips.hedera.com/hip/hip-820).

This library facilitates the implementation of the **WalletConnect <> Hedera Spec** which allows
wallets and dApps to natively integrate with Hedera. It provides additional, out of network
functionality with the `hedera_signMessage` function.

In short, it uses the Hedera javascript SDK to build transactions, serialize them, send to
wallets for processing and return responses back to dApps.

_Please note, this is distinct from the
[Implementation of Ethereum JSON-RPC APIs for Hedera](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-json-rpc-relay).
At the time of this writing, "the Hedera JSON-RPC relay implementation is in beta, offers
limited functionality today, and is only available to developers."_

_The relay and this library have different intentions and serve different purposes - namely
native Hedera integration vs. Ethereum compatability layers to ease developer onboarding for
those more familiar with the Ethereum ecosystem._

## Set up

To start using WalletConnect, sign up for an account at <https://cloud.walletconnect.com>. You
will use your project id when initializing client libraries.

It is important to understand core WalletConnect concepts when integrating this library. Please
reference the [WalletConnect documentation](https://docs.walletconnect.com/2.0/).

## Usage

Upon successfully configuring your dApp and/or wallet to manage WalletConnect sessions, you can
use this libraryâ€™s functions to easily create and handle requests for the Hedera network.

### Wallet

This library provides a Wallet class that extends the
[ Web3Wallet ](https://github.com/WalletConnect/walletconnect-monorepo/tree/v2.0/packages/web3wallet)
class provided by WalletConnect class

#### Event Listeners

WalletConnect emits various events during a session. Listen to these events to synchronize the
state of your application:

```javascript
// Handle pairing proposals
signClient.on('session_proposal', (event) => {
  // Display session proposal to the user and decide to approve or reject
})

// Handle session requests, like signing transactions or messages
signClient.on('session_request', (event) => {
  // Process the session request
})

// Handle session deletions
signClient.on('session_delete', (event) => {
  // React to session termination
})
```

#### Pairing with dApps

Pairing establishes a connection between the wallet and a dApp. Once paired, the dApp can send
session requests to the wallet.

##### a. Pairing via URI

If a dApp shares a URI for pairing:

```javascript
await signClient.core.pairing.pair({ uri: 'RECEIVED_URI' })
```

Upon successful pairing, the `session_proposal` event will be triggered.

##### b. Pairing via QR Codes

For a better user experience, dApps often share QR codes that wallets can scan to establish a
pairing. Use a QR code scanning library to scan and obtain the URI, then proceed with pairing:

```javascript
const scannedUri = '...' // URI obtained from scanning the QR code
await signClient.core.pairing.pair({ uri: scannedUri })
```

#### Handling Session Proposals

Upon receiving a `session_proposal` event, display the proposal details to the user. Allow them
to approve or reject the session:

##### Handling Session Requests

Upon receiving a `session_request` event, process the request. For instance, if the dApp
requests a transaction to be signed:

### DApp

This library provides a simple interface to connect to a wallet and send requests using the
DAppConnector class, which wraps the WalletConnect signClient and WalletConnectModal.

#### Initialization

```javascript
import {
  DAppConnector,
  HederaSessionEvent,
  HederaChainId,
} from '@hashgraph/walletconnect-hedera'
import { LedgerId } from '@hashgraph/sdk'

const dAppMetadata = {
  name: '<Your dapp name>',
  description: '<Your dapp description>',
  url: '<Dapp url>',
  icons: ['<Image url>'],
}

const extensionIds = ['<Extension ID>']

const dAppConnector = new DAppConnector(
  dAppMetadata,
  LedgerId.TESTNET,
  projectId,
  Object.values(HederaJsonRpcMethod),
  [HederaSessionEvent.ChainChanged, HederaSessionEvent.AccountsChanged],
  [HederaChainId.Testnet],
  extensionIds,
)
await dAppConnector.init()
```

#### Pairing with Wallets

Establish a connection between a dApp and a wallet by pairing them. Multiple accounts can be
paired simultaneously.

```javascript
const session = await dAppConnector.openModal()
```

#### Sending Requests

Once paired, the dApp can send requests to the wallet. For instance, if the dApp wants to
request a transaction to be signed:

```javascript

const transaction = new TransferTransaction()
      .addHbarTransfer(0.0.12345, -1)
      .addHbarTransfer(receiver, 1)

const accountId = AccountId.fromString('0.0.12345')
const transactionSigned = await dAppConnector.signTransaction(
  accountId
  transaction,
)
```

##### 1 - hedera_getNodeAddresses

```javascript
const nodeAddresses = await dAppConnector.getNodeAddresses()
```

##### 2- hedera_ExecuteTransaction

```javascript
const transactionSigned = await dAppConnector.executeTransaction(
  accountId
  transaction,
)
```

##### 3- hedera_signMessage

```javascript
const response = await dAppConnector.signMessage(accountId, message)
```

##### 4- handleExecuteQuery

```javascript
const response = await dAppConnector.executeQuery(accountId, query)
```

##### 5- hedera_signAndExecuteTransaction

```javascript
const response = await dAppConnector.signAndExecuteTransaction(
  accountId
  transaction,
)
```

##### 6- hedera_signTransaction

```javascript
const transaction = await dAppConnector.signTransaction(
  accountId
  transaction,
)
```

#### Get a Signer

Use the accountId of a paired account to retrieve a signer and simplify interactions with the
Wallet and multiple accounts.

```javascript
const signer = dAppConnector.getSigner(AccountId.fromString('0.0.12345'))
const response = await signer.signAndExecuteTransaction(transaction)
```

#### Events

The events exposed by the DAppConnector can be accessed through the `walletConnectClient` prop.
To learn more about these events, please refer to
[WalletConnect Session Events](https://specs.walletconnect.com/2.0/specs/clients/sign/session-events).

```javascript
  dAppConnector.walletConnectClient.on('session_event', (event) => {
    // Handle session events, such as "chainChanged", "accountsChanged", etc.
    console.log(event)
  })

  dAppConnector.walletConnectClient.on('session_request_sent', (event) => {
    // Handle session events, such as "chainChanged", "accountsChanged", etc.
    console.log('session_request_sent: ', event)
  })

  dAppConnector.walletConnectClient.on('session_update', ({ topic, params }) => {
    // Handle session update
    const { namespaces } = params
    const _session = dAppConnector.walletConnectClient!.session.get(topic)
    // Overwrite the `namespaces` of the existing session with the incoming one.
    const updatedSession = { ..._session, namespaces }
    // Integrate the updated session state into your dapp state.
    console.log(updatedSession)
  })
```

#### Disconnecting

##### Disconnect single session

```javascript
dAppConnector.disconnectSession(session.topic)
```

##### Disconnect all sessions

```javascript
dAppConnector.disconnectAllSessions()
```

#### Extension popup

By default, it is not possible to directly pop up an extension with Wallet Connect. However, to
allow this possibility, the dAppConnector accepts a list of extension IDs. If you create the
AppConnector with an extension ID, it will automatically send a message to the extension to
detect if it is installed. In case the extension is installed, it will be added to the available
extensions and its data can be found at the extensions property of dAppConnector.

To connect an available extension, use the method `connectExtension(<extensionId>)`. This will
link the extension to the signer and session. Whenever you use the signer created for this
session, the extension will automatically open. You can find out if the extension is available
by checking the `extensions` property.

```javascript
const dAppConnector = new DAppConnector(
  dAppMetadata,
  LedgerId.TESTNET,
  projectId,
  Object.values(HederaJsonRpcMethod),
  [HederaSessionEvent.ChainChanged, HederaSessionEvent.AccountsChanged],
  [HederaChainId.Testnet],
  ['<Extension ID 1>, <Extension ID 2>'],
)

[...]

dAppConnector?.extensions?.forEach((extension) => {
  console.log(extension)
})

const extension = dAppConnector?.extensions?.find((extension) => extension.name === '<Extension name>')
if (extension.available) {
  await dAppConnector!.connectExtension(extension.id);
  const signer = dAppConnector.getSigner(AccountId.fromString('0.0.12345'))

  // This request will open the extension
  const response = await signer.signAndExecuteTransaction(transaction)
}
```

Wallets that are compatible should be able to receive and respond to the following messages:

- `"hedera-extension-query-<extesnionId>"`: The extension is required to respond with
  `"hedera-extension-response"` and provide the next set of data in the metadata property.
  ```javascript
  let metadata = {
    id: '<extesnionId>',
    name: '<Wallet name>',
    url: '<Wallet url>',
    icon: '<Wallet con>',
    description: '<Wallet url>',
  }
  ```
- `"hedera-extension-open-<extensionId>"`: The extension needs to listen to this message and
  automatically open.
- `"hedera-extension-connect-<extensionId>"`: The extension must listen to this message and
  utilize the `pairingString` property in order to establish a connection.

This communication protocol between the wallet and web dApps requires an intermediate script to
use the Chrome API. Refer to the
[Chrome Extensions documentation](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/messaging)

To enable communication between the extension and a web dApp embedded in an iframe, the wallet
must support the following messages:

- `"hedera-iframe-query"`:The extension is required to respond with `"hedera-iframe-response"`
  and provide the next set of data in the metadata property.
  ```javascript
  let metadata = {
    id: '<extesnionId>',
    name: '<Wallet name>',
    url: '<Wallet url>',
    icon: '<Wallet con>',
    description: '<Wallet url>',
  }
  ```
- `"hedera-iframe-connect"`: The extension must listen to this message and utilize the
  `pairingString` property in order to establish a connection.

The dAppConnector is designed to automatically initiate pairing without any need for user
action, in case no sessions are noticed and an iframe extension is detected. To capture this
event and the newly established session, you can utilize the `onSessionIframeCreated` function.
